master/palin
	master reads an input file of strings into shared memory, then spawns children processes of palin to determine whether each string is a palindrome,
or until a set process limit, or time limit, is reached; each child process is responsible for one string, which it writes to either palin.out or nopalin.out
as appropriate; palin also writes process info to output.log, while ensuring that only one process can access those resources at a time, thus solving the critical
section problem.
	


Installation
	After download, navigate to the directory containing the source files. From the command line, enter "make -f makefile"



Invocation
	From the directory containing the master and palin executables:
master -h
master [-n x] [-s x] [-t time] file

./master file    // processes strings in file, assuming a newline follows each string
./master -n x file 	// processes strings in file, with non-default value for max total child processes 
./master -s x file 	// processes strings in file, with non-default value for max active child processes 
./master -t time file 	// processes strings in file, with non-default value for max time before program exits
./master -h    // prints description of master, including all possible options



Version Control
	Git was used for version control. A full change log can be found at https://github.com/adwzq4/OS-Project-2/commits/master
